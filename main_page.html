                  The rubik's cube has been around for almost 50 years now and it has evolved immensely. First the 3x3 and then came the 2x2, 4x4, 5x5, 6x6, all the way to the 16x16. Not only do we have so many different types of cubes to play with, they have also become extremely smooth and efficient to use and very creative with the mechanics.

                  Then came a new concept called speedcubing. Like its name suggests, it litterally means solving a <b>puzzle</b> very quickly. A puzzle that is not necessarily a cube. You could be solving a <a href="https://ruwix.com/twisty-puzzles/pyraminx-triangle-rubiks-cube/">pyramix</a> and some would refer to it as speedcubing.
              </p>
              <p>However, a better term would be <b>speedsolving</b>.</p>

              <p>
                  In my opionion, the world of speedsolving is wonderful and broad. It is so satisfying to scramble and then solve a puzzle again and again. It could also easily get addicted to it so watch out for that as well. So if you haven't tried it out then why wait? This guide is right here for you!

                  To get started, you must have a puzzle. In this guide, we will be focusing on the 3x3 cube.
                  So if you don't already have a 3x3 cube lying around at home then go ahead and buy one. It could
                  be available in a toy store nearby or even in a supermarket. If are completely unable to find a
                  cube at your local area then <a href="https://speedcubeshop.com/">speedcubeshop</a> is a very reliable
                  online retailer that sells all the authentic cubes that you could think of.
                  If you are just starting then get yourself a <a href="https://speedcubeshop.com/products/yuxin-little-magic-3x3?_pos=2&_sid=13d7aa303&_ss=r">YuXin Little Magic</a> for $4.95.

                  Next, if you are just starting out and have little to no knowledge of solving a 3x3 rubik's cube,
                  go ahead and click <a href="beginners_instructions.html">here</a> to go to the page in which I explain how to solve a cube using the beginner's method(CFOP).

                  After getting familiar with the beginner's method, you should now have better intuition and faster turning and
                  be ready to learn the Fridrich's method. The Fridrich's method is based of the beginner's method, but it's faster and
                  more efficient and needs more memorizing. Memorization of algorithms which are basically series of cube notations that
